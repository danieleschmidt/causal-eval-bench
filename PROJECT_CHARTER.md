# Project Charter: Causal Eval Bench

## Project Overview

**Project Name**: Causal Evaluation Benchmark (causal-eval-bench)
**Project Owner**: Daniel Schmidt (Terragon Labs)
**Start Date**: January 2025
**Status**: Active Development

## Problem Statement

Current language model evaluations focus heavily on pattern recognition and statistical associations, failing to adequately test genuine causal reasoning capabilities. Existing benchmarks often conflate correlation with causation, leaving critical gaps in our understanding of AI systems' ability to reason about cause-and-effect relationships.

## Project Purpose

Develop a comprehensive evaluation framework that rigorously tests language models' understanding of:
- Causal attribution vs. correlation
- Counterfactual reasoning
- Causal intervention effects
- Multi-step causal chains
- Confounding variable identification

## Success Criteria

### Primary Objectives
- ✅ **Comprehensive Evaluation Suite**: Deploy 5+ distinct causal reasoning task types
- ✅ **Multi-Domain Coverage**: Support 15+ specialized domains (medical, economic, scientific, etc.)
- ✅ **Automated Test Generation**: Generate novel causal reasoning problems to prevent contamination
- ✅ **Interactive Leaderboard**: Provide real-time model performance tracking
- ✅ **Research Integration**: Enable academic research with standardized evaluation protocols

### Success Metrics
- **Adoption**: 100+ research papers citing the benchmark within first year
- **Coverage**: 95%+ test coverage across all evaluation components
- **Performance**: Sub-second response times for simple queries
- **Scalability**: Support 1000+ concurrent evaluations
- **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime SLA for critical operations

### Quality Gates
1. **Technical Excellence**: All code must pass automated testing, linting, and security scans
2. **Research Validation**: Domain experts must validate all specialized test sets
3. **Reproducibility**: All evaluation results must be deterministically reproducible
4. **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation for all user-facing features
