### 🟡 **Manual Setup Required**
Due to GitHub App permission limitations, the following require manual setup by repository maintainers:

1. **GitHub Actions Workflows**: Copy templates from `docs/workflows/examples/` to `.github/workflows/`
2. **Repository Secrets**: Configure required secrets as documented in `docs/workflows/README.md`
3. **Branch Protection Rules**: Configure main branch protection as documented
4. **GitHub Environments**: Setup staging and production environments
5. **Team Assignments**: Create GitHub teams as defined in CODEOWNERS

## 📋 **Next Steps for Repository Maintainers**

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **Activate Workflows** (5 minutes):
   ```bash
   # Copy workflow templates
   mkdir -p .github/workflows
   cp docs/workflows/examples/*.yml .github/workflows/
   ```

2. **Configure Secrets** (10 minutes):
   - Add required API keys and credentials to GitHub repository secrets
   - Follow the complete list in `docs/workflows/README.md`

3. **Setup Branch Protection** (5 minutes):
