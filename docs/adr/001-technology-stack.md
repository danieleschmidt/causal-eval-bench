# ADR-001: Technology Stack Selection

## Status
Accepted

## Date
2025-01-27

## Context
We need to select the core technology stack for the Causal Evaluation Benchmark project. The system will need to:

1. Support complex evaluation workflows
2. Handle multiple model API integrations
3. Generate and manage large test sets
4. Provide both programmatic and web interfaces
5. Scale to handle thousands of evaluations
6. Maintain high reliability and performance

## Decision
We will use the following technology stack:

### Core Language: Python 3.9+
- **Rationale**: Dominant language in ML/AI research community
- **Benefits**: Rich ecosystem, extensive ML libraries, easy model API integration
- **Trade-offs**: Performance limitations for compute-intensive tasks

### Web Framework: FastAPI
- **Rationale**: Modern, fast, automatic API documentation
- **Benefits**: Type hints, async support, OpenAPI integration
- **Alternatives Considered**: Flask (less modern), Django (too heavy)

### Database: PostgreSQL + SQLite
- **Rationale**: ACID compliance, JSON support, reliability
- **Benefits**: Mature ecosystem, excellent performance, flexible data types
- **Development**: SQLite for local development
- **Production**: PostgreSQL for production deployments

### Caching: Redis
- **Rationale**: Fast in-memory storage for evaluation results
- **Benefits**: Pub/sub capabilities, data structure variety
- **Use Cases**: API response caching, session storage, queue management

### Testing Framework: pytest + hypothesis
- **Rationale**: Mature, flexible, property-based testing support
- **Benefits**: Excellent plugin ecosystem, parameterized tests
- **Hypothesis**: For generative testing of evaluation logic

### Package Management: Poetry
- **Rationale**: Modern dependency management, lock files
- **Benefits**: Virtual environment management, publishing support
- **Alternatives Considered**: pip + requirements.txt (less robust)

### Documentation: Sphinx + MkDocs
- **Rationale**: Standard in Python ecosystem
- **Benefits**: Auto-generation from docstrings, theme variety
- **MkDocs**: For user-facing documentation
- **Sphinx**: For API reference documentation

### CI/CD: GitHub Actions
- **Rationale**: Integrated with repository, free for open source
- **Benefits**: Matrix builds, marketplace actions, secret management
- **Workflows**: Testing, linting, building, deployment

### Containerization: Docker + Docker Compose
- **Rationale**: Consistent deployment, environment isolation
- **Benefits**: Easy local development, production parity
- **Docker Compose**: Local development with dependencies

### Monitoring: Prometheus + Grafana
- **Rationale**: Industry standard, open source
- **Benefits**: Flexible metrics collection, beautiful dashboards
- **Integration**: Custom metrics for evaluation performance

## Consequences

### Positive
- Familiar technology stack for Python developers
- Excellent library ecosystem for ML/AI tasks
- Strong typing support with modern Python features
- Fast development iteration with hot reloading
- Comprehensive testing capabilities
- Easy deployment and scaling options

### Negative
- Python performance limitations for CPU-intensive tasks
- Additional complexity from multiple database systems
- Redis dependency adds operational overhead
- Learning curve for teams unfamiliar with FastAPI

### Mitigation Strategies
- Use async/await for I/O-bound operations
- Consider Rust/Go microservices for performance-critical components
- Provide Docker Compose for easy local development
- Comprehensive documentation and examples

## Implementation Notes

### Development Environment
```bash
# Required Python version
python >= 3.9

# Package manager
poetry install

# Local development
docker-compose up -d
```

### Production Deployment
- Kubernetes manifests for container orchestration
- Helm charts for configuration management
- CI/CD pipeline for automated deployments
- Health checks and monitoring integration

### Performance Considerations
- Connection pooling for database access
- Redis clustering for high availability
- Async processing for long-running evaluations
- CDN for static assets and documentation

## Review Schedule
This decision will be reviewed in 6 months (July 2025) or when significant issues arise.
