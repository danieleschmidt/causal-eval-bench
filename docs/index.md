**Comprehensive evaluation framework for testing genuine causal reasoning in language models**

---

## 🎯 What is Causal Eval Bench?

Causal Eval Bench is a cutting-edge evaluation framework designed to assess the causal reasoning capabilities of language models. Unlike traditional benchmarks that focus on correlation or surface-level pattern matching, our framework tests genuine understanding of cause-and-effect relationships, counterfactual reasoning, and causal interventions.

### Key Features

- **🧠 Causal Reasoning Tests**: Evaluate understanding of causation vs correlation
- **🔄 Counterfactual Generation**: Test ability to reason about alternative scenarios  
- **⚡ Intervention Analysis**: Assess understanding of causal interventions
- **🌍 Domain Coverage**: 15+ domains from medicine to economics
- **🤖 Automatic Test Generation**: Create novel causal reasoning problems
- **📊 Interactive Leaderboard**: Track model performance with live updates

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
pip install causal-eval-bench
```

### Basic Usage

```python
from causal_eval import CausalBenchmark, ModelEvaluator

# Initialize benchmark
benchmark = CausalBenchmark()

# Evaluate a model
evaluator = ModelEvaluator(
    model_name="gpt-4",
    api_key="your-api-key"
)

# Run evaluation
results = benchmark.evaluate(
    evaluator,
    tasks=["causal_attribution", "counterfactual", "intervention"],
    num_examples=100
)

print(f"Overall Score: {results.overall_score:.2%}")
```

## 📋 Evaluation Tasks

### 1. Causal Attribution
Test ability to identify true causes vs. mere correlations.

```python
question = "Ice cream sales and swimming pool accidents both increase in summer. 
           Does eating ice cream cause swimming accidents?"
# Expected: No - this is spurious correlation due to confounding variable (temperature)
```

### 2. Counterfactual Reasoning
Assess understanding of "what if" scenarios.

```python
scenario = "A student studied hard and passed the exam. 
           What if the student had not studied?"
# Expected: Lower probability of passing, reasoning about causal mechanisms
```

### 3. Causal Intervention
Test understanding of the effects of interventions.

```python
intervention = "A thermostat controls room temperature. 
               What happens if we manually set it to 30°C?"
# Expected: Room temperature will change, understanding of causal mechanisms
```

## 🌟 Why Causal Eval Bench?

### Beyond Correlation
Most existing benchmarks inadvertently test pattern matching rather than causal understanding. Our framework specifically targets:

- **Spurious Correlations**: Distinguish between causation and correlation
- **Confounding Variables**: Identify and reason about confounders
- **Causal Mechanisms**: Understand underlying causal processes
- **Intervention Effects**: Predict outcomes of causal interventions

### Comprehensive Coverage
- **15+ Domains**: Medical, economic, social, scientific, legal, environmental
- **Multiple Difficulty Levels**: Easy, medium, hard, expert
- **Diverse Question Types**: Multiple choice, open-ended, ranking
- **Real-world Scenarios**: Based on actual causal relationships

### Research-Grade Quality
- **Validated Questions**: Expert-reviewed test cases
- **Reproducible Results**: Deterministic evaluation protocols
- **Statistical Rigor**: Proper significance testing and confidence intervals
- **Publication Ready**: Results suitable for academic publication

## 🛠️ Advanced Features

### Custom Domains
Create evaluation tasks for your specific domain:

```python
from causal_eval.domains import DomainBuilder

climate_domain = DomainBuilder.create_domain(
    name="climate_science",
    description="Climate and weather causation",
    example_phenomena=["greenhouse_effect", "ocean_currents"]
)
```

### Adversarial Testing
Generate challenging test cases that exploit model weaknesses:

```python
from causal_eval.generation import AdversarialGenerator

adv_gen = AdversarialGenerator()
challenging_tests = adv_gen.generate(
    base_model="gpt-4",
    exploit_weaknesses=True
)
```

### Performance Analysis
Deep dive into model performance patterns:

```python
from causal_eval.analysis import ErrorAnalyzer, CausalProfiler

analyzer = ErrorAnalyzer()
error_patterns = analyzer.analyze_errors(results)

profiler = CausalProfiler()
capability_profile = profiler.create_profile(model, results)
```
