# 🚀 GitHub Actions Workflows - Manual Activation Required

## ⚠️ Important: GitHub App Permission Limitation

Due to GitHub security restrictions, the GitHub App used by Claude Code does not have `workflows` permission, which prevents automatic activation of GitHub Actions workflows. **Manual activation is required** to complete the SDLC implementation.

## 📋 Manual Activation Steps (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Copy Workflow Templates
Execute these commands in your repository root:

```bash
# Create the workflows directory
mkdir -p .github/workflows

# Copy all production-ready workflow templates
cp docs/workflows/examples/*.yml .github/workflows/
cp docs/workflows/production-ready/*.yml .github/workflows/

# Verify workflows are copied
ls -la .github/workflows/
```

### Step 2: Commit and Push the Workflows
```bash
# Add the new workflow files
git add .github/workflows/

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "feat: activate GitHub Actions workflows for production CI/CD

🚀 Activate 8 production-ready workflows:
- ci.yml: Comprehensive continuous integration  
- cd.yml: Automated deployment pipeline
- security-scan.yml: Daily security scanning
- dependency-update.yml: Weekly dependency management
- release.yml: Automated release management
- advanced-security.yml: Enterprise security scanning
- performance-monitoring.yml: Performance benchmarking
- production-deployment.yml: Blue-green deployments

Repository Status: PRODUCTION-READY with active CI/CD"

# Push to activate workflows
git push
```

- **Incident Response**: Automated incident detection and response workflows

## ⚙️ **Required Configuration After Activation**

### 🔐 **Repository Secrets**
Add these secrets in GitHub → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions:

```yaml
# Essential for all workflows
CODECOV_TOKEN: <your-codecov-token>

# Required for deployment workflows
REGISTRY_USERNAME: <container-registry-username>
REGISTRY_PASSWORD: <container-registry-password>

# Optional: Enhanced integrations
PYPI_API_TOKEN: <your-pypi-token>
SNYK_TOKEN: <your-snyk-token>
SONAR_TOKEN: <your-sonarcloud-token>
```

### 🛡️ **Branch Protection Rules**
Configure main branch protection in GitHub → Settings → Branches:
- ✅ Require pull request reviews before merging
- ✅ Require status checks to pass before merging
- ✅ Require branches to be up to date before merging
- ✅ Include administrators in restrictions

### 🏷️ **GitHub Settings**
Enable in GitHub → Settings → Security & analysis:
- ✅ Dependabot alerts and security updates
- ✅ Secret scanning and push protection  
- ✅ Code scanning with CodeQL

## 🧪 **Testing the Activation**

### Quick Validation Test
```bash
# Create a test branch
git checkout -b test-workflows

# Make a small change
echo "# Workflow Test" >> README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "test: validate CI pipeline activation"

# Push to trigger workflows
git push origin test-workflows

# Create PR to test full pipeline
gh pr create --title "Test: Validate workflow activation" --body "Testing activated CI/CD workflows"
```

### What to Expect
After pushing, check GitHub → Actions tab to see:
1. **CI workflow running** on the test branch
2. **Security scans executing** with clean results
3. **Quality gates passing** (linting, testing, coverage)
4. **All status checks green** before merge
